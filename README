Currently only supports interval based scheduling. Also, currently requires job services to be registered with a dependency injection framework (using the Microsoft CommonServiceLocator).

Usage:

var factory = new DefaultSchedulerFactory();
var scheduler = factory
	.UseContainer(() => new CastleServiceProvider(container))
	.Create();

scheduler.Setup(
	Job<TestJob>.Run(x => x.RunJob()).Every(1.Second()),
	Job<TestJob2>.Run(x => x.RunJob()).Every(2.Seconds())
).Start();
